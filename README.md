# blackjack-game
Blackjack game I coded in Java, used this project as a way to learn ArrayLists and some String methods. 
I haven't yet explored the GUI aspect of the game, it is still something that I want to learn. 

In the future, I will come back to this project to implement a GUI, specifically using SwingX.
